## Moravian Lives
Moravian Lives is a collaborative research project led by Professor Katherine Faull, and involves scholars from institutions around the world. The purpose of Moravian Lives is to consider the experiences of Moravians beginning in the 18th century as they established communities across Europe and the UK, North America, the Caribbean, and beyond. Project team members have been involved in transcription, translation, and encoding of memoirs in German, English, and other languages. As they are encoded these memoirs are made available in web-accessible formats. Researchers are also analyzing the memoirs to reveal patterns in these ego documents through spatial, sentiment, and social network analysis.

This is the top level repository for the Moravian Lives organization on GitHub. There are three directories: ML, moravianlives, and master. ML is the working directory; the other two are archives of older work.

## ML Directory Structure
All current Moravian Lives project files can be found in the ML repository. 

### Memoirs
* Memoir files are organized in directories by archive: [Bethlehem](https://github.com/moravianlives/ML/tree/master/Bethlehem), [Fetter Lane](https://github.com/moravianlives/ML/tree/master/FetterLane), and [Fulneck](https://github.com/moravianlives/ML/tree/master/Fulneck)
* Each directory includes a variety of file types depending on the transcription and encoding work done on those files. Fulneck memoirs were transcribed in Transkribus and then exported in 'Searchable PDF' and 'Standard XML' files. They are encoded for semantics and structure in TE-XML. See schema file for documentation about encoding methodology. 

### Memoir Images
* All images are stored in .jpg format in a top-level directory named 'IMG'. Within that directory images are separated by archive: Fulneck (MAF), Fetter Lane (MAL), Bethlehem (MAB), Nazareth (MAN).

### Processing Files
* All files required for encoding and transforming TEI documents can be found in the [CodeScripts](https://github.com/moravianlives/ML/tree/master/CodeScripts) directory.
