## Moravian Lives
Moravian Lives is a collaborative research project led by Professor Katherine Faull, and involves scholars from institutions around the world. The purpose of Moravian Lives is to consider the experiences of Moravians beginning in the 18th century as they established communities across Europe and the UK, North America, the Caribbean, and beyond. Project team members have been involved in transcription, translation, and encoding of memoirs in German, English, and other languages. As they are encoded these memoirs are made available in web-accessible formats. Researchers are also analyzing the memoirs to reveal patterns in these ego documents through spatial, sentiment, and social network analysis.

This is the top level repository for the Moravian Lives project (ML) organization on GitHub.
